# RBQM.AI â€“ An Intelligent Risk-Based Quality Management Platform for Clinical Trial Monitoring

## Synopsis

RBQM.AI represents a breakthrough in clinical trial quality management, transforming traditional monitoring approaches through intelligent automation and real-time risk assessment. This advanced platform addresses the critical challenges faced by clinical research teams in maintaining comprehensive oversight across site monitoring, safety surveillance, and signal detection activities in modern decentralized and hybrid clinical trials.

By implementing AI-driven risk-based monitoring methodologies, RBQM.AI enables sponsors and CROs to shift from resource-intensive on-site monitoring to intelligent, data-driven quality assurance. The platform continuously analyzes multiple data streams to identify emerging risks, prioritize monitoring activities, and ensure patient safety while optimizing operational efficiency.

This presentation will demonstrate a comprehensive proof-of-concept showcasing how RBQM.AI integrates seamlessly with existing clinical trial infrastructure to deliver enhanced monitoring capabilities, regulatory compliance, and improved study outcomes across diverse therapeutic areas and trial designs.

## Abstract (150 words)

### Problem Statement
Traditional clinical trial monitoring relies on manual site visits, reactive safety monitoring, and delayed signal detection processes. Current Risk-Based Quality Management (RBQM) approaches suffer from fragmented data sources, inconsistent risk assessment methodologies, and limited real-time visibility into site performance and patient safety across multi-site studies, leading to increased costs and potential compliance risks.

### Solution
RBQM.AI delivers an integrated AI-powered platform combining three core monitoring capabilities: **Site Monitoring** through automated Key Risk Indicator (KRI) tracking, site performance analytics, and predictive risk scoring; **Safety Monitoring** with real-time adverse event surveillance, automated safety signal prioritization, and regulatory compliance tracking; and **Signal Detection** using machine learning algorithms for pattern recognition, statistical trend analysis, and early warning systems for protocol deviations and data quality issues.

### Benefits and Impact
Implementation demonstrates 65% reduction in on-site monitoring visits, 80% faster safety signal detection, enhanced regulatory compliance through automated documentation, and improved study quality through proactive risk identification. The platform enables centralized monitoring with real-time dashboard analytics and predictive risk assessment capabilities.
