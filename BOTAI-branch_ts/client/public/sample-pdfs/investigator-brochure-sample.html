        <h2>1. Summary</h2>
        <p>GZT-34 is a novel selective glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist being developed for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus. This Investigator's Brochure provides an overview of the relevant information available on GZT-34, including data on its pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, safety, and clinical experience to date.</p>

        <h2>2. Introduction</h2>
        <p>GZT-34 is an investigational compound that activates the GLP-1 receptor, leading to enhanced glucose-dependent insulin secretion, decreased glucagon secretion, delayed gastric emptying, and increased satiety. These effects contribute to improved glycemic control and weight loss in patients with type 2 diabetes.</p>
        
        <h3>2.1 Chemical Structure and Formulation</h3>
        <p>GZT-34 is a synthetic peptide analog of human GLP-1 with several modifications that extend its half-life and improve its resistance to degradation by DPP-4. The compound is formulated as a clear, colorless solution for subcutaneous injection, available in pre-filled pens containing 1.5 mg/mL of active ingredient.</p>

        <h2>3. Preclinical Studies</h2>
        
        <h3>3.1 Pharmacology</h3>
        <p>In vitro studies have demonstrated that GZT-34 binds to the human GLP-1 receptor with high affinity (Ki = 0.3 nM), exhibiting approximately 5-fold higher potency than native GLP-1. In preclinical models, GZT-34 has shown the following effects:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Glucose-dependent stimulation of insulin secretion</li>
            <li>Inhibition of glucagon secretion</li>
            <li>Delay of gastric emptying</li>
            <li>Reduction in food intake and body weight</li>
            <li>Preservation of Î²-cell mass and function in animal models of diabetes</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>3.2 Pharmacokinetics</h3>
        <p>In animal studies, GZT-34 demonstrated the following pharmacokinetic properties:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Terminal half-life: 28-35 hours across species (rat, dog, monkey)</li>
            <li>Bioavailability after subcutaneous administration: 65-78%</li>
            <li>Minimal metabolism, with renal filtration as the primary elimination route</li>
            <li>No significant inhibition or induction of cytochrome P450 enzymes</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>3.3 Toxicology</h3>
        <p>Comprehensive toxicology studies have been conducted in rats (up to 26 weeks) and monkeys (up to 39 weeks). Key findings include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>No treatment-related mortality at doses up to 50 times the anticipated human dose</li>
            <li>Expected pharmacologic effects (reduced food intake, decreased body weight)</li>
            <li>Minimal injection site reactions that resolved without intervention</li>
            <li>No evidence of genotoxicity in standard assays</li>
            <li>No carcinogenicity signals in 2-year rat studies</li>
            <li>No adverse effects on fertility or embryo-fetal development in rats or rabbits</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. Clinical Experience</h2>
        
        <h3>4.1 Phase 1 Studies</h3>
        <p>Three Phase 1 studies have been completed, including single ascending dose (SAD) and multiple ascending dose (MAD) studies in healthy volunteers and a 14-day study in patients with type 2 diabetes.</p>
        
        <h4>4.1.1 Safety and Tolerability</h4>
        <p>GZT-34 was generally well-tolerated at doses up to 3.0 mg once daily. The most common adverse events were:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Nausea (27% vs. 7% placebo)</li>
            <li>Vomiting (12% vs. 2% placebo)</li>
            <li>Headache (15% vs. 12% placebo)</li>
            <li>Injection site reactions (8% vs. 5% placebo)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Gastrointestinal events were generally mild to moderate in intensity, transient, and decreased in frequency with continued dosing. No serious adverse events were considered related to the study drug.</p>

        <h2>6. Guidance for Investigators</h2>
        
        <h3>6.1 Dosing and Administration</h3>
        <p>For the PRO001 clinical trial, GZT-34 will be initiated at 0.3 mg once daily for 2 weeks, followed by dose escalation to 0.6 mg once daily. Depending on glycemic response and tolerability, further dose escalation to 1.2 mg may be considered after an additional 2 weeks.</p>
        
        <h3>6.2 Risk Mitigation</h3>
        <p>To minimize gastrointestinal adverse events, patients should be advised to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Start at the lowest dose and escalate as per protocol</li>
            <li>Eat smaller meals</li>
            <li>Stop eating when feeling full</li>
            <li>Avoid high-fat meals</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>6.3 Monitoring Recommendations</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Monitor blood glucose regularly, especially when initiating therapy</li>
            <li>Consider dose reduction of concomitant insulin or sulfonylurea to reduce hypoglycemia risk</li>
            <li>Assess for signs and symptoms of pancreatitis at each visit</li>
            <li>Monitor renal function periodically</li>
        </ul>
