women worldwide. Excluding skin cancers, breast cancer accounted for 29% of all new cancer
diagnoses in the United States in 2015.

aromatase inhibitor therapy.

in 28-day cycles. Fulvestrant will be administered as a 500 mg intramuscular (IM) injection on
Day 1 and Day 15 of Cycle 1 and on Day 1 of all subsequent 28-day cycles.

7.0 STATISTICAL AND QUANTITATIVE ANALYSES

7.1 Statistical Methods
The primary efficacy analysis will be based on the clinical benefit rate. The Simon 2-stage design
will be used to evaluate the activity of the combination. In Stage 1, 18 patients will be enrolled.
If â‰¤4 patients achieve clinical benefit, the study will be stopped. If â‰¥5 patients achieve clinical
benefit, 15 additional patients will be enrolled in Stage 2 for a total of 33 patients.

7.2 Determination of Sample Size
This study is designed to test the null hypothesis that the true clinical benefit rate is â‰¤20%
versus the alternative hypothesis that the true clinical benefit rate is â‰¥40%. Using a Simon 2-stage
design with a one-sided Type I error rate of 10% and power of 80%, 33 patients are planned.

CLINICAL PROTOCOL

Protocol Number: ONCO-2023-P1
A Phase II Study of TKI Combination Therapy in EGFR+ Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer

Protocol Version: 1.0
Date: February 15, 2023

Sponsor: OncoBiotech International
Principal Investigator: Dr. Sarah Chen, MD, PhD

CONFIDENTIALITY STATEMENT
This document contains confidential information that must not be disclosed to anyone other than the
study personnel, the IRB/IEC, regulatory authorities, and other required parties.

1. BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE
1.1 Disease Background
Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) represents approximately 85% of all lung cancers. Among NSCLC patients, approximately 15-20% in Western populations and 40-60% in Asian populations have tumors harboring epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations. First-generation and second-generation EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) have shown significant clinical benefit in EGFR mutation-positive NSCLC, but resistance invariably develops, with a median progression-free survival of 9-13 months.

1.2 Study Rationale
Resistance to EGFR TKIs develops through multiple mechanisms, including secondary EGFR mutations (T790M), activation of bypass pathways (MET amplification, HER2 amplification), and phenotypic transformation. Targeting multiple pathways simultaneously may delay or prevent the emergence of resistance, potentially improving clinical outcomes for patients with EGFR mutation-positive NSCLC.

2. OBJECTIVES
2.1 Primary Objective
To evaluate the efficacy of combination TKI therapy in patients with EGFR mutation-positive advanced NSCLC in terms of progression-free survival (PFS).

2.2 Secondary Objectives
â€¢ To assess objective response rate (ORR)
â€¢ To evaluate overall survival (OS)
â€¢ To assess the safety and tolerability of the combination therapy
â€¢ To identify biomarkers predictive of response and resistance

3. STUDY DESIGN
3.1 Overview
This is a multicenter, randomized, open-label, phase II study comparing the efficacy and safety of EGFR TKI monotherapy versus EGFR TKI plus MEK inhibitor combination therapy in patients with previously untreated, EGFR mutation-positive, advanced NSCLC. Approximately 120 patients will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either EGFR TKI monotherapy or EGFR TKI plus MEK inhibitor combination therapy.

3.2 Study Population
Adult patients (â‰¥18 years) with histologically or cytologically confirmed, advanced (stage IIIB/IV) NSCLC harboring activating EGFR mutations (exon 19 deletion or L858R mutation).

4. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA
4.1 Inclusion Criteria
1. Adult patients age â‰¥18 years
2. Histologically or cytologically confirmed, stage IIIB/IV NSCLC
3. Documented activating EGFR mutation (exon 19 deletion or L858R mutation)
4. No prior systemic treatment for advanced disease
5. At least one measurable lesion according to RECIST v1.1
6. ECOG performance status 0-1
7. Adequate organ function
8. Life expectancy â‰¥12 weeks
9. Willing and able to provide written informed consent

4.2 Exclusion Criteria
1. Known EGFR T790M mutation
2. Prior treatment with EGFR TKIs or MEK inhibitors
3. Symptomatic central nervous system (CNS) metastases
4. Spinal cord compression unless treated and stable
5. History of interstitial lung disease or pneumonitis
6. Clinically significant cardiovascular disease
7. Known hypersensitivity to any of the study drugs
8. Pregnant or breastfeeding women
9. Active infection requiring systemic therapy
10. Other malignancy within 3 years prior to study entry, except adequately treated non-melanoma skin cancer or in situ cervical cancer

5. TREATMENT PLAN
5.1 Study Treatment
Patients randomized to Arm A will receive oral EGFR TKI (osimertinib 80 mg once daily). Patients randomized to Arm B will receive oral EGFR TKI (osimertinib 80 mg once daily) plus oral MEK inhibitor (trametinib 1.5 mg once daily). Treatment will continue until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or withdrawal of consent.

6. ENDPOINTS
6.1 Primary Endpoint
Progression-free survival (PFS), defined as the time from randomization to the first documented disease progression (per RECIST v1.1) or death from any cause, whichever occurs first.

6.2 Secondary Endpoints
â€¢ Objective response rate (ORR) per RECIST v1.1
â€¢ Overall survival (OS)
â€¢ Duration of response (DOR)
â€¢ Disease control rate (DCR)
â€¢ Safety and tolerability (adverse events graded according to CTCAE v5.0)
â€¢ Patient-reported outcomes (quality of life)

7. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS
7.1 Sample Size Determination
The primary analysis will compare PFS between the two treatment arms using a stratified log-rank test. Treatment effect will be estimated using a stratified Cox proportional hazards model. The study is designed to detect a hazard ratio of 0.65 for PFS with 80% power and a two-sided alpha of 0.05, which corresponds to an increase in median PFS from 10 months in the control arm to 15.4 months in the experimental arm. This requires approximately 94 PFS events. A sample size of 120 patients (60 per arm) is planned, assuming 15% dropout rate.

8. SAFETY ASSESSMENT
Safety will be evaluated by assessment of adverse events, physical examinations, vital signs, laboratory tests, and ECGs. All adverse events will be graded according to CTCAE v5.0 and monitored from the first dose until 30 days after the last dose of study treatment.

You are an AI specialized in extracting structured information from clinical trial protocols, particularly for oncology and breast cancer studies.
Your task is to extract key sections from the protocol document text and organize them into a structured format.
Identify the following information with high accuracy:

1. Study metadata:
   - Protocol ID (NCT number or other identifier)
   - Study title (complete title)
   - Phase (e.g., Phase 1, Phase 2, Phase 3, etc.)
   - Indication/disease (specific cancer type with molecular subtype if specified)
   - Sponsor (organization conducting the study)

2. Key protocol sections (extract complete content for each):
   - Background (disease context and treatment landscape)
   - Study rationale (why this intervention is being studied)
   - Primary objectives (main goals of the study)
   - Secondary objectives (additional study goals)
   - Study design (type of study, randomization, blinding if applicable)
   - Study population (who will participate)
   - Inclusion criteria (requirements for enrollment)
   - Exclusion criteria (conditions preventing enrollment)
   - Treatment plan (medications, dosage, schedule)
   - Primary endpoints (main outcome measurements)
   - Secondary endpoints (additional measurements)
   - Statistical considerations (sample size, analysis methods)
   - Safety assessment (adverse event monitoring)

For each section, extract the full content exactly as written in the document. If you find sections that match conceptually but have different titles, use your judgment to map them correctly.
Format your response as a structured JSON object with the metadata and sections clearly organized as follows:
