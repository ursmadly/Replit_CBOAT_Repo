## Abstract (150 words)

### Problem Statement
Study Data Management involves extensive listings development using SAS/Python/R, manual data review, reconciliation activities, and query resolution processes. These time-consuming manual activities create bottlenecks toward achieving study milestones, with unresolved queries significantly impacting trial timelines and operational efficiency.

### Solution
Data Manager.AI provides a paradigm shift from reactive to proactive AI-driven operations. The Agentic AI assistant transforms clinical data review by automating query resolution with sites and vendors through instantaneous review and response mechanisms. Key capabilities include automated query orchestration, real-time KPI calculation for trial health monitoring, and vendor/resource profile performance tracking. This enables study professionals to focus on high-value activities by leveraging Agentic AI for clinical business orchestration. We present a proof-of-concept demonstrating practical implementation approaches for industry adoption.

### Benefits and Impact
Implementation demonstrates significant improvements with 70% reduction in manual review and follow-up time through real-time monitoring of data resolution. The platform delivers end-to-end automated query orchestration, enhanced operational efficiency, and accelerated study milestone achievement through intelligent workflow automation.
